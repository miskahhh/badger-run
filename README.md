# Badger Run 🦡🏃‍♂️

A 3D endless-runner inspired by the Chrome “Dino Run” offline game — built with **THREE.js** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

## Requirements Checklist (what this repo is designed for)
- ✅ Uses THREE.js (no CS559Framework)
- ✅ Runs in a single HTML **canvas**
- ✅ Two modes:
  - **Prototype**: primitive geometries only, **no image textures**
  - **Full**: allows **loaded models and textures**
- ✅ Works with keyboard + mobile-friendly controls (we’ll add on-screen buttons)
- ✅ Animated world objects even without user interaction
- ✅ Shows your **Group Name** and **4-digit Group ID** at the top of the page

> Update the banner text in `index.html`:
`Badger Run — GROUP_NAME (1234)`
